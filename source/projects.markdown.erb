Alex is collaborating with theoretical physicist Geoff Milward to produce a new
body of work exploring magnetism and phase transitions. The work will consist
of a series of time based pieces and kinetic sculpture.

 

## The Sea Cabinet

<%# video %>

The above video gives you a glimpse into Alex’s latest collaboration with
musical adventurer Gwyneth Herbert in which music, art and science come
together. In direct response to Gwyneth’s album, developed during an artist
residency for Aldeburgh Music, she explores the science of cymatics for your
sensory pleasure as a live, interactive performance. We present to you an
extraordinary symbiotic blend of music, film, art and storytelling that
explores stories from inshore and out.

 

## Penlington and Carr

<%# Penlington and Carr %>

Alex is currently in the developmental stage of a collaboration with a tailor
of Savile Row. This project aims to bring together the worlds of traditional
craft, couture, fine art and new technologies, with an altogether darker feel
than her usual practice allows.

Please subscribe to the mailing list to be kept informed of further
developments.
