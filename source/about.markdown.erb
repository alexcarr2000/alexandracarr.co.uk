> Alexandra Carr is a sculptor working with patterns in nature, natural
> processes and phenomena. Her work is heavily science based and experimental
> in nature.

Taking inspiration from x-ray crystallography, Kepler’s packing of spheres,
moiré patterns, eclipses, orbits of comets and philosophical works of
antiquity, Alexandra Carr reveals unseen order, beauty and symmetry of natural
phenomena.

The quadrivium forms the basis of her source material, with recent works
focusing on sound waves, rhythm, harmonics and periodicity. Whilst drawing
inspiration from the cyclic aspect of the natural world, platonic solids,
sacred geometry and arabesques, she connects the teachings of antiquity, both
spiritual and scientific, to current technologies and theories, particularly
quantum theory. Her practice is formed of both the study of spatial geometry
and scientific experimentation. Carr’s static ceramic works condense the
concepts of sacred geometry and its resultant natural processes into physical
manifestations, transmuting the abstract into the permanent and precious.

Carr’s work centres on the dimensions, proportions, curves and forms which have
compelled and inspired man universally for millennia, exploring how the golden
ratio, geometry and mathematics play a role in the human perception of beauty
in an attempt to understand its’ ubiquity and appeal.

The golden ratio can be seen from the arrangement of branches along the stems
of plants, parts of the shells of molluscs and cephalopods, skeletons of
animals and the branching of their veins and nerves, to the proportions of
chemical compounds and the geometry of crystals; the golden ratio can even be
discovered at work at the atomic level.

Carr’s work investigates this through the repetition of forms, leading to
emerging patterns of a larger scale alongside natural, self-referential,
iterative systems which display self-similarity and fractal geometry. Such
systems possess time-scales ranging from the growth of seedlings to the
regeneration of new continents, and they are observed both on the microscopic
and macroscopic scale.

From the hexagonal cell construct of honeybees to the effortless fractal
emergence of African villages, the cosmic significance of geometric forms seems
unequivocal and may be regarded as a universal law. This special ‘blueprint’
connects us all universally. The thing which sets us apart from this magical
phenomenon is our awareness of it; our human fallibility shows not only our
inability to comprehend these ‘divine’ laws but also our humility as mere cogs
in the wheel. As with quantum theory, superposition collapses the moment
observation takes place, our grasp of the universal order leaves us the moment
we try to hold onto the essence of it.

This notion of perpetual change despite the universal order provokes Carr to
give particular weight to the process of transformation and the moment of
change. Boundaries between states of matter and chaotic structures – such as
glass as a disordered solid – are a point of exploration as are phase
transitions, affecting the atomic structure and resulting form, dictating our
interaction with the environment.

The critical moment at which water crystallizes into ice or evaporates into gas
has resonance and immense significance. It is these transient moments upon
which she focuses, the moment of change from order to disorder and disorder to
order; the balance between chaotic and ordered systems. Phase locking of
systems demonstrate fleeting moments of order, as if that moment is
comprehension manifested, however ephemeral.

frequencies through water.

Recent research and work concerning cymatics, sound waves and the growth and
structure of crystals has led her to explore the periodicity of dripping
fluids. She is currently executing works using liquid porcelain following a
recent emergence into kinetic ceramic sculpture and the notion of using the
medium as a time based media. Her work with liquid porcelain has been related
to the science of cymatics and fluid dynamics which is developing into the
notion of a more gradual change of form and structure as a result of erosion
and growth by accretion.

science of pasing sound through liquids.

Growth, decay and rebirth are strong notions within the work in terms of
transformation and transience and can be identified with both in terms of
geological and chemical science as well as on a spiritual level. It may even be
considered a meditative tool by which one can gain illumination, awakening and
reconnection with the universal order.
